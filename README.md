## Motivation
Neghbourly is an App developed to help the community buy from local producers. In our global world, we are always striving to find the best discount, the most for our money.
Doing that we do not think about the quality of the food we receive, as often we do get what we have paid for. To be able to produce quality food, the producers have to invest in their ground, stock, equipment. And that of course is the goal of every farmer, but the issue arises when the producers have to pay the extra bill for getting their products certified as "ECO". To apply for the certificate and to get the product inspected each farmer has to follow very strict rules and lose a lot of money and energy on trying to do so. That is not always possible and profitable for the small privately-owned producers. 

Of course, that does not in any way mean that their product is not a high-quality product, on the contrary, many times the local producer will deliver a higher quality product as they do their job out of love and not out of greed.

That’s where Neighbourly comes to the rescue. Neigbourly will allow the producers to list their products the moment they harvest/produce them so that the locals living within the area can surf through the products and buy directly from the producer. Furthermore, if a customer cannot find the products they need, they will have the possibility to contact the producers and give them suggestions on what might be nice to have. For each buy, the customers will be able to review their purchase, which will ensure the high quality of the products. 

Neighbourly will help the world reduce the daily CO2 emissions, as the products will not need to be transported to more than 20-30 km from where the customer lives. 

Let’s help each other, let’s help the world, and let’s live a healthier life through healthier food!

Neghbourly, because we do care!
